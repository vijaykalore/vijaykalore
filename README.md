Hi â€” Iâ€™m Vijay. I turn data into insights and ideas into reliable AI products. I enjoy building end-to-end systems (from data collection to deployment) and working on products that save people timeâ€”like tools that summarize long videos or automate job search workflows. I balance practical engineering with rigorous evaluation so models actually help users.

Quick highlights
- Built a video transcription + summarization agent that turns long videos into concise, context-aware summaries.
- Automated job-search and resume-improvement agent that reduces search time and improves interview readiness.
- Intern experience in Generative AI and Data Science â€” improved LLM/chatbot satisfaction and built robust ML pipelines [see Experience] [1].

What I do
- Prototype and productionize ML/DL models (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Build LLM-powered products and retrieval-augmented systems (RAG, vector DBs).
- Create REST/async APIs and interactive UIs for ML tools.
- Optimize model performance and pipeline reliability for real users.

Featured tech stack

(Full list of libraries and tools is based on my work and projects) [1].

Featured projects
### AI-agent â€” Transcribe & Summarize Videos
- What: End-to-end system that transcribes speech (Whisper) and produces short, context-aware summaries.
- Why: Save time for learners, researchers, and creators; improves accessibility.
- Tech: Python, Whisper, Hugging Face Transformers, FastAPI, Streamlit, FFmpeg.

### Automated Job Search & Career Assistant
- What: Agent that parses resumes, fetches jobs from portals (Naukri / Indeed / LinkedIn), suggests resume improvements, and runs mock interviews.
- Impact: Cuts job-search time and increases interview readiness.
- Tech: Python, web scraping/APIs, NLP transformers, lightweight UI.

### LLMOps Playground (example)
- What: Small platform to experiment with RAG, vector stores, and LLM deployments with monitoring.
- Why: Helps iterate quickly on prompts, retrieval layers, and performance tuning.
- Tech: FastAPI, vector DB (e.g., FAISS / Milvus), Docker, simple CI.

### Open-source Toolkit â€” Resume Analyzer (idea)
- What: A reusable pipeline that scores resumes against job descriptions and suggests concrete edits.
- Why: Practical, reusable for applicants and recruiters.
- Tech: NLP embeddings, cosine-similarity, explainable suggestions.

More projects & demos (short)
- Tiny apps: demo dashboards, model cards, evaluation notebooks.
- Automations: scheduled data pulls, simple ETL + monitoring jobs.
- Research: prototype experiments around prompt engineering and low-cost fine-tuning.

Experience
- Generative AI Intern â€” improved LLM-based chatbot UX via prompt engineering and reduced model perplexity with targeted tuning.
- Data Science Intern â€” built ML models and deep learning pipelines; delivered measurable accuracy improvements and production-ready code [1].

How I work
- Start with the user problem, define evaluation criteria, then iterate quickly (prototype â†’ eval â†’ harden).
- Emphasize reproducibility, tests, and small, measurable wins.
- Prefer modular systems: decoupled data ingestion, model, and serving layers.

Thanks for reading â€” if you want a different tone (shorter, more formal, fun), or want badges and stats added now, tell me which style and Iâ€™ll update it.
